A set of scripts I've used for a couple of years to integrate with VIM.
Consists of a wrapper written in Python to pass JSLint args and a list of Global
vars, a shell script that calls the wrapper and passes in the file name (had trouble
calling the python script directly from VIM, it's on a TODO) and the JSLint cmdline tool.

You'll need to install Rhino for this to work.

TODO:

1.  Cleanup so that it works on systems other then mine
2.  Make an installer
3.  Have said installer pull the latest cmdline version of JSLint
4.  Test with MacVim
5.  Possibly convert to Ruby? (I spend most of my time doing Ruby dev now, so it would
        be easier to share this with co-workers)
